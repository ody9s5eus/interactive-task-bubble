# ✨ BubbleDo - The Vibe Check for Your Tasks 🫧

> "It's giving productivity but make it fun." 💅

Yo, welcome to **BubbleDo**. Forget those boring list apps that look like your boomer dad's Excel sheet. We’re tossing your tasks into a physics engine because why not? It’s purely bussin, no cap. 🧢

## 📸 The Fit / Aesthetics

Picture this: Your tasks are bubbles. They float. They bounce. You can Yeet™ them across the screen.
**Glassmorphism?** Check. 🧊
**Physics?** Yes, Isaac Newton would be proud (or confused). 🍎

## 🚀 How to Use (It’s not rocket science bestie)

1.  **Add a Task:** Tap that big `+` button. Type your stuff. Hit enter. Boom, bubble spawned. 🥚
2.  **Play God:** Drag those bubbles around. Throw them. Watch them collide. It’s oddly satisfying, fr fr. 😌
3.  **Delete (The Trash Can Arc):** Drag a bubble to the trash icon. Gone. Reduced to atoms. 🗑️
4.  **Pop It:** Double-click (or drag-spam) a bubble to POP it. *Satisfying pop noises in your head*. 💥

## 🛠️ The Stack (For the nerds 🤓)

We cooked this up with the freshest ingredients:

*   **React + Vite:** Fast asf boi. ⚡
*   **TypeScript:** Cuz we hate bugs fr. 🛡️
*   **Matter.js:** The physics engine doing the heavy lifting. 💪
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Making it look drip. 💧
*   **Framer Motion:** Smooth animations only. 🎥
