# 🫧 Interactive Task Bubble 🫧

**Yo fam!** Welcome to the **Interactive Task Bubble** project! This ain't your grandma's to-do list—we're talkin' physics-based task bubbles that you can drag, bounce, and pop! It's giving *main character energy*. 💅

## What's the Vibe? 🧐

Imagine if your tasks were like... actual bubbles? And you could just YEET them across the screen? That's what we built. It's built with React, Matter.js (for the physics), and a whole lotta love.

**Key Features:**
- **Physics-Based**: Drag 'em, drop 'em, watch 'em collide. It's oddly satisfying. 😌
- **Pop to Complete**: Double-click a bubble to complete the task. *Pop!* Gone. 👋
- **Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism vibes only. We keep it clean and blurry. 🌫️
- **Responsive**: Works on your phone too, bestie. 📱
